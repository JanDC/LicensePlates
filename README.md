# LicensePlates

Django project to read license plates from an (webcam)image.

The main logic is derived from the PyALPR sript [https://github.com/lukagabric/PyALPR], which in turn uses fswebcam and openalpr [https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr].

The sample images are provided by http://www.plateshack.com/
